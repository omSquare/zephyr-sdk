Zephry Development Environment
==============================

A Ubuntu-based docker image suitable for [Zephyr RTOS](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr)
development. Contains all [required tools](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html)
and the [Zephyr Meta SDK](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/installation_linux.html#zephyr-sdk).

Zephyr is expected to be located in `/zephyr` directory â€” either clone it there
or mount your local Zephyr repository on this path.
